## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
Although this may be a simple and easy project project but it was quite the task for me as a beginner. I learned various new styling tricks and techniques.
For an instance, the flexbox part helped me understand the core basics even more thoroughly.
In short,this project helped me grasp how to actually use styles and put my newly learned skills to work.

Having no mentors in the cs field, I completed this project majorly by myself. Whenever i was stuck on a certain piece of code I would search the internet for solutions to questions posted by people who were also stuck similarly before me.
